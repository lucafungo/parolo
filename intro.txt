Welcome in PAROLO! the cheap and sgangherata version of the popular wordle game.
To play you need to type a five letter word, 
the program will compare your word with the 'word of the day'
and display it as follow:
[GREEN] if the letter is in the right position
[YELLOW] if the letter is in the 'word of the day' but in a different position
[WHITE] if the letter is not in the 'word of the day

(Type 'H' to reprint this intro, 'R' to close the game)
You got 6 attempts!
